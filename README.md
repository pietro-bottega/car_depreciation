# Car Matching system

## Overview

This project aims to create a model to match similar cars from Brazil's market based on user input. It is based on Python, and uses as features information extracted from *Tabela FIPE*, a monthly survey of car prices in Brazil.

## Dataset
The data set is [*Tabela FIPE*:](https://veiculos.fipe.org.br), a national survey of monthly average car prices on resalle for end customers in Brazil.
For data extraction, I leveraged the [fipe-crawler](https://github.com/rafaelgou/fipe-crawler/) created by @rafaelgou.

## Methodology

This project uses a machine learning algorithm to compare similar cars from the dataset. The process involves feature extraction from the dataset, defining a similarity function, and training based on available data.

## Tools and Technologies

### Programming language

- Python

### Libraries:

- Pandas: used to manipulate structured data, such as .csv files extracted from the *Tabela FIPE*.

### Data Visualization:
